What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 
ANS: you can add two different logic files to the stagging area and commit both the files together to the repository. 
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Ans * First add files that are related to the first logical change you want to commit, and after making it sure you have staged all the files, make a commit. Next you stage other files that are related to the second logical change you want to commit, and so on.
