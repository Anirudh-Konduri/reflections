When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* When I want to make it public.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
*Answer: There might be conflicts we should deal with.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
*You use a fork to copy someone's GitHub repository into a repository under
your own GitHub account. You would want to use fork to make changes to
a repository on GitHub that you don't have a permission to change. On the
other hand, you can use clone to behave like a fork, but clone will only
apply to your local repositories on your computer. You could also clone
GitHub repositories to your local computer. Branches will allow you to
fix a bug or add a feature on a branch of the tree that is not the master
branch. Branching will allow you to control when you can logically merge
your changes back to the master branch. Branch allows you to collaborate
with other people in a team or individually to only roll out stable and
tested code.
